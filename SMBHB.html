      <h2>Project Background/Intro</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the CIERA REU program, I worked in Professor Adam Miller's Time Domain group with Dr. Caitlin Witt (Check out her amazing paper on this topic <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07465.pdf" style="text-decoration: none;color:red;">HERE!</a>) to develop a pipeline which employs <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/06/bayesian-statistics-beginners-simple-english/#What_Is_Bayesian_Statistics?" style="color:orange;">Bayesian Statistics</a> to search for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries by identifying Quasars with Periodic Variability.</p><br><br>

        <h5>What is a Supermassive Black Hole?</h5>
      <p>There is evidence for the existence of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at the center of almost every known large (non-dwarf) galaxy. Despite being incredibly small on a galactic scale (about the same size to their host galaxies as a singular atom would be to a human), they exert remarkable influence over their host galaxies. Certain physical SMBH properties have been shown to correlate with properties of their host galaxy--most notably, the M-sigma relationship, among others relating the black hole mass to the galactic bulge mass [reference]. Furthermore, in periods of active accretion, SMBHs are known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): As they shred apart nearby stars and gas clouds, a surrounding hot accretion disk produces immense radiation pressure and, on occasion, sends off jets of hot (T ~ 10^7 K) material at relativistic speeds. This activity, known as AGN feedback, is equally capable of thrusting the star into brief periods of explosive star formation as it is of plunging the galaxy into dark quiescence. Though our knowledge of how they came to be so massive is limited, current research suggests a strong link between their evolution and the surrounding galactic environment.</p><br><br>

        <h5>What about a Supermassive Black Hole Binary?</h5>
        <p>We expect Supermassive Black Hole Bianries (SMBHBs) are the inevitable outcomes of SMBH-hosting galaxy mergers. If our theory of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Natur.435..629S/abstract" style="color:orange;">hierarchical galaxy formation</a> is correct, such mergers play an enormous role in the evolution of galaxies and the entire universe. Needless to say, studying these systems is necessary to understand galactic evolution; and, such extreme environments would serve as multi-messenger laboratories, where electromagnetic (light) and gravitational wave (GW) observations can complementarily probe the system in unprecedented detail.</p><br><br>
        
        <h5>How do we detect a SMBHB?</h5>
        <p>In extremely close orbits (≤1 milliparsec), we expect SMBHs, at their incredible mass and miniscule separation on the milliparsec scale, would emit detectable GWs at Nanohertz frequency. Following recent evidence for a GW background found by the <a href="https://nanograv.org/" style="color: orange;">NANOgrav coalition</a>, the prospect of locating individual SMBHBs using Pulsar Timing Arrays is of paramount interest.<br><br>

        Of more direct interest to my research, we also expect some close-orbit SMBHB systems to exhibit periodically variable brightness. Whether due to periodic interactions with a circumbinary accretion disk (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/436/4/2997/984794" style="color:orange;">D’Orazio et al. 2013</a>; <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/783/2/134" style="color:orange;">Farris et al. 2014</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_beaming" style="color:orange;">Relativistic Doppler Boosting</a> (), this unique signature offers detection potential <i>given a robust time series analysis pipeline</i>. This is where my research comes in.</p><br><br>

        <h5>The Search for Periodicity in Quasar Light Curves</h5>
        <p>Periodic SMBHB systems would exhibit stochastically variable brightness best modeled by a red noise process called the Damped Random Walk (DRW) (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/721/2/1014" style="color:orange;">MacLeod et al. 2010</a>) <i>along with</i> additive sinusoidal variability (Skewed sinusoids can be a product of orbital inclination and ellipticity, but aren't accounted for in this research).<br><br>
            
        <img src="DRWCW Model.png" style="display:block;width:90%;margin-left:5%;margin-top:30px"><br>
        The DRW model (Left) is used to model a singular SMBH light curve. The DRW+Sine model (Right in green) uses the previous model, but adds periodic variability related to the orbital mechanics of the SMBHB.<br><br>

        To sift through the two signals present and detect evidence for periodicity, we use 3 methods: Lomb Scargle Periodograms (LS), the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ), and a Nested Bayesian Sampler (NBS). My research advisor, Caitlin Witt, published a paper detailing the advantages and challenges of using the NBS to detect periodicity among red noise. My research includes additional granular analyses of the NBS performance and novel evaluation of the other two methods. Future research will involve the use of Machine Learning in combining these three methods and optimizing light curve classification and characterization.<br><br>

        For each method, the procedure is as follows:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Simulate 1000+ light curves--half will be strictly DRW (simulating SMBHs) and the other half will be DRW+Sine (simulating SMBHBs)</li>
          <li>For a given method (and given survey specifications), run a complete analysis on all light curves</li>
          <li>Compare output parameters to input simulation parameters. Note: LS and WWZ only carry out periodic searchers, and cannot, with accuracy, estimate parameters of underlying quasar stochastic variability.</li>
          <li>Gauge model selection for each method, and evaluate binary classification efficacy.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Results (So far!)</h2>
      <p>
        In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11497.pdf" style="text-decoration:none;color:red">previous paper (Chen et al.)</a> a group created a model similar to the pipeline we've created, and published a sample of 127 objects which their model predicts are periodic quasars, or Supermassive Black Hole Binaries.<br><br>
        Below are 4 light curve plots (brightness over time) of 2 objects, SDSSJ002815.26+201420.8 and SDSSJ004744.03+190338.5. The first two plots are the light curves and analyses performed on these objects by the Chen et al. and the second two plots are analyses we have performed on these objects with our pipeline. We and the Chen et al. group use different samplers (emcee vs. ultranest) and our analysis includes an additional ~year of data.<br><br>

        <cap>Plots of two objects' light curves (Brightness over time). Blue data points are observations from the <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/about-ztf.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:orangered;">Zwicky Transient Facility</a>. Dashed black line is the underlying periodic signal which our pipeline believes it found. The &Delta;BIC tells us how strongly the pipeline believes this light curve was generated by a Supermassive Black Hole Binary. <b>Due to the small &Delta;BIC of -18 << -10, our pipeline has strong evidence that object SDSS J002815.26+201420.8 is a Supermassive Black Hole Binary</b>
        </cap><br><br>
        While these results are interesting, in order to interpret them with full context, we need to apply the pipeline to many light curves. The SDSS J002815.26+201420.8 object with a strong &Delta;BIC may be a very unique occurrence or a common finding with our pipeline. We'll be moving forwarrd, applying the pipeline to even more light curves to get some answers soon. Any new results will be posted here!

      <!-- As of publishing this website, we have only applied the pipeline to 4 real light curves. Out of these four light curves, we have  -->

      <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
      <p>This program has been one of the best opportunities I have ever participated in. From the incredible leadership from my advisor Dr. Caitlin Witt, to the plethora of coding workshops, to the presentation and networking opportunities, the CIERA REU has equipped me with all the tools I need to make a decision on my future and succeed in whatever I choose.<br><br>
      Though I have worked with python for a little over a year now, my work this summer has helped me improve my coding skills by orders of magnitude. I've become intimately familiar with command line and have spent weeks working with Quest, a High Performance Computing Cluster, in order to handle massive data sets. I've improved my ability to simulate and interpret data with new packages and visualizations in python. Most notably, I worked with Bayesian Statistics in the form of the ultranest package Reactive Nested Sampler and have plotted myriad results with the matplotlib library--a researchers favorite tool.<br><br>
      More important than experience with any specific package, however, I have gained priceless experience in using my creativity to analyze and experiment with pre-existing code and to problem-solve through any adversity this brings. Working with Bayesian Statistics code which analyzes Supermassive Black Hole Quasar Light Curves with a Postdoc who works with NANOGrav is such a unique and niche opportunity which I have been fortunate to earn, however the experience I've gained will help me no matter what I choose to pursue in the future.
